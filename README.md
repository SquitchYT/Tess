# Why another terminal?

Tess was mainly built in order to offer you a new, intuitive, fully customizable, and blazing fast terminal app by using the power of web technologies.

Why should you not test it? We've worked on this for more than 2 years, and we've been relied on by thousands of users.

Tess is currently officially tested on Windows and Linux, but it should also work on other platforms.
If you do not have access to Tess yet, fill out an issue, and we'll try to provide you with the best cross-platform experience by making new packages or helping you manually install Tess.

# Installation | Linux

## Requirements

* Have an OS with `x86` arch type

<br>

## Installation from the archive

We provide packages for most major distributions; simply select the one that matches your distro and install it.

<br>

## Installation with PPA

If you prefer using apt over downloading and installing the `deb` archive, you could set up the PPA and download Tess with these
```bash
apt install curl apt-transport-https gnupg2

curl -s https://apt.tessapp.dev/key.gpg | gpg --dearmor | tee /usr/share/keyrings/tess.gpg > /dev/null

echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tess.gpg] https://apt.tessapp.dev stable main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tess-packages.list

apt update && apt install tess
```

<br>

## Installation with AUR

On Arch Linux, the recommended way to install Tess is to use an AUR package manager like [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay)
```sh
yay -S tess-git
```

<br>

## Installation with RPM repository

If you are on RHEL-derived distros, you may also want to add our RPM repository to install Tess and receive updates automatically with your package manager.

```bash
yum install curl 

curl https://rpm.tessapp.dev/tess.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/tess.repo

yum check-update && yum install tess
```
<br>

# Installation | Windows

## Requirements

* `Windows 10 64 bits` or superior

<br>

## Installation from Installer

Simply download and execute the installer, available on the [releases](https://github.com/SquitchYT/Tess/releases) page.

<br>

## Installation using Winget

<br>

If you are running on `Windows 10 1709 (build 16299)` or superior, you could download [Winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli). It may also already be installed on your system.<br>
Next, execute the following command.

```sh
winget install Squitch.Tess
```

<br>
